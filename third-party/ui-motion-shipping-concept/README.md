I know, I should be hanged for shipping three carrots in a huge truck. Maybe next time I'll make a drone collect the parcel?

This is one of three experiments in this collection: [UI Motion explorations](https://codepen.io/collection/DgggNa/)

You know that feeling when you've completed an order online and click ship it...?

Yeah, nice right?

In this exploration I'm trying to anchor and extend that sweet feeling while solving some UX stuff:

* eliminate the perception of waiting by entertaining the user while the purchase is being processed (2 seconds)
* in a fun and emotional, yet sensible way, clearly show that the stuff you bought is on its way to you
* reinforce a brand perception, in this case casual and playful

I experiment with JS, GSAP, UX, motion and more, so follow if you like that kinda stuff!
